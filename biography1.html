    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli’s career is one of the most iconic stories in the history of cricket. Born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi, he started playing cricket at a very young age and joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy under coach Rajkumar Sharma. Kohli’s determination, aggressiveness, and discipline helped him grow rapidly through junior-level cricket. His breakthrough came in 2008 when he captained the Indian Under-19 team to victory in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. Soon after, he was selected for the Indian national team, marking the beginning of a legendary journey.

    Kohli became known for his consistent batting, unmatched chase-mastery, and strong work ethic. Between 2012 and 2019, he became one of the world's top batsmen, dominating across all formats. He was appointed the captain of the Indian Test team in 2014 and the ODI/T20 captain in 2017. Under his leadership, India reached the top of the Test rankings, won historic series including the first-ever Test series victory in Australia (2018–19), and consistently performed well in ICC tournaments.

    He became the fastest player to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, and 12,000 ODI runs, breaking numerous world records. Kohli is admired for his intensity, fitness, and discipline, revolutionizing Indian cricket’s fitness culture. His career continues to inspire millions worldwide, making him one of the greatest cricketers of all time.
     Virat Kohli’s rise in international cricket is often described as one of the most dominant of the modern era. After his ODI debut in 2008, Kohli steadily climbed the ranks with his fearless batting style and brilliant consistency. By 2011, he secured his place in the World Cup squad and played an important supporting role in India’s historic World Cup win. His ability to handle pressure, especially during run-chases, made him one of the most reliable batsmen in the world.

     Kohli’s aggressive approach was not only in batting but also in leadership. As captain, he transformed India into a fitter, more competitive, and more mentally tough team. Under his leadership, India defeated almost every major team in their home conditions, and his Test team won back-to-back series in Australia, South Africa, and England. His fearless attitude also encouraged younger players to express themselves freely on the field.

     Even after stepping down as captain in 2022, Kohli continued his strong form as a batsman. His comeback century in the Asia Cup 2022 against Afghanistan ended his long century drought and marked the beginning of a new dominant phase. Kohli proved once again that he is one of the most complete and adaptive players in cricket history.</p>

    <h2 id="educational-life">Educational Life</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli completed his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School and later at Saviour Convent School in Delhi. Even during school, Kohli was deeply committed to cricket, spending hours training at the West Delhi Cricket Academy. His teachers and coaches described him as a hardworking and focused student, though cricket was always his top priority.

    Despite his demanding cricket schedule, Kohli balanced academics reasonably well in his early years. However, as his cricketing career progressed, he devoted most of his time to training, matches, and travel. His school life played a major role in shaping his discipline, leadership qualities, and mental strength. Though he didn’t pursue higher education formally, Kohli’s success story is a reminder that dedication and passion can lead to extraordinary achievements.
    Even though Kohli eventually devoted more time to cricket than studies, the values he learned in school—punctuality, determination, teamwork, and leadership—became essential throughout his career. His early school coaches often described him as a “child who never wanted to leave the field,” reflecting his early passion and dedication.

    Though he didn’t pursue higher college degrees, Kohli’s success is a testament to the idea that dedication and passion can lead to excellence, regardless of traditional educational paths.</p>

    <h2 id="marriage">Marriage</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli married Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma on 11 December 2017 in a beautiful and private ceremony in Tuscany, Italy. The wedding followed traditional Hindu rituals and was attended only by family and close friends. Their wedding pictures became viral across the world and remained one of the most talked-about celebrity weddings in India.

    After their wedding, they hosted grand receptions in Delhi and Mumbai. Kohli and Anushka welcomed their daughter Vamika on 11 January 2021 and later announced the birth of their son Akaay on 15 February 2024. The couple is widely admired for their humility, strong partnership, and support for each other’s careers.
    Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s marriage is often considered one of India’s most loved and respected celebrity relationships. Before their marriage, the couple dated for several years after first meeting during a shampoo commercial shoot. Their relationship stayed strong despite busy schedules and media attention.

    Their wedding in Italy was private, peaceful, and elegant, reflecting their personalities. Anushka has often mentioned how grounded, supportive, and respectful Kohli is as a partner. Kohli describes Anushka as the “center of his world” and credits her for making him more patient, spiritual, and self-aware.

    In 2021, they became parents to their daughter Vamika, and in 2024, they welcomed their son Akaay. Kohli has repeatedly emphasized the importance of privacy and a normal upbringing for his children. His family life has brought him emotional balance, which he believes has made him a better cricketer and human being.</p>

    <h2 id="professional-life">Professional Life</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli’s professional cricketing journey is defined by excellence, leadership, and determination. He made his international debut for India in 2008 and soon became one of the most reliable batsmen in the team. His aggressive mindset, smart batting techniques, and unmatched consistency helped him dominate bowlers worldwide.

    Kohli excelled in all three formats—Tests, ODIs, and T20s—making him one of the greatest batsmen of his generation. He served as India’s captain across formats and achieved numerous milestones, including a historic Test series win in Australia, multiple bilateral series victories, and maintaining India at the top of the Test rankings.

    In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli has been a key figure for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), holding records such as the highest single-season run tally (973 runs in 2016). Beyond cricket, Kohli is known for his brand endorsements, fitness initiatives, and philanthropy through the Virat Kohli Foundation. His professional life reflects discipline, leadership, passion, and global influence.</p>
